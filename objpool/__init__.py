creation, destruction, allocation and release of their specific objects.

class ObjectPool(object):
    """Generic Object Pool.

    The pool consists of an object set and an allocation semaphore.

    pool_get() gets an allocation from the semaphore
               and an object from the pool set.

    pool_put() releases an allocation to the semaphore
               and puts an object back to the pool set.

    Subclasses must implement these thread-safe hooks:
    _pool_create()
            used as a subclass hook to auto-create new objects in pool_get().
    _pool_verify()
            verifies objects before they are returned by pool_get()
    _pool_cleanup()
            cleans up and verifies objects before their return by pool_put().

    While allocations are strictly accounted for and limited by
    the semaphore, objects are expendable:

    The hook provider and the caller are solely responsible for object
    handling.

    pool_get() may create an object if there is none in the pool set.
    pool_get() may return no object, leaving object creation to the caller.
    pool_put() may return no object to the pool set.
    Objects to pool_put() to the pool need not be those from pool_get().
    Objects to pool_get() need not be those from pool_put().


    Callers beware:

    - The pool limit size must be greater than the total working set of
      objects, otherwise it will hang. When in doubt, use an impossibly large
      size limit.  Since the pool grows on demand, this will not waste
      resources.  However, in that case, the pool must not be used as a flow
      control device (i.e.  relying on pool_get() blocking to stop threads), as
      the impossibly large pool size limit will defer blocking until too late.

    - The pool cannot be shared among processes as the semaphore that it
      relies upon will be copied when the new process is being created.
